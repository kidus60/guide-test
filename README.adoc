= Creating a Node.js Project with Codewind

== What you'll Learn

In this guide, we'll provide an example of quickly creating a Node.js project from scratch using Codewind. 

== Getting Started

This guide assumes that you've already completed the steps of https://microclimate.dev/codewindtechpreview#installing-codewind[this guide to install Codewind and the Eclipse plugin].

== Create a new Node.js Project using Codewind in Eclipse
With the Codewind and Eclipse plugin installaltions complete, you are only a few clicks away from having a running Node.js application.

1. Open Eclipse to the workspace in which you wish to create the new Node.js project.
1. Open the Project Exploerer view (Window -> Show View -> Project Explorer) and select "Create a Project".  
1. In the New Project window, drop down the Codewind folder and select "New Project" then click "Next".
1. Select a name for your new project, select the "Node.js Express" project template, and click "Finish"
1. Open the Codewind Explorer view (Window -> Show View -> Other -> Codewind -> Codewind Explorer). Your new project will take some time to build.
1. Once the build completes and the project is running, right click on the project and select "Open Application" to see your Node.js template running.

The Node.js template includes some basic Express routing. https://expressjs.com/[More info on routing with Express can be found here.]

That's it; your new Node.js project is up and running! Open the Project Explorer view and observe that all of the files necessary to start up the app have been automatically generated.
